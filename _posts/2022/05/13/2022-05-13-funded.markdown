We start [StreamCardano](https://www.streamcardano.com) project.
[Catalyst Fund8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s3jCE7pmoUujy3ASMia-UhFl2KLi_hnf/view) will fund the project for the first year with <span class="tw__font-bold tw__font-mono tw__text-green-600">$239,000</span> in ADA.

We currently work on a prototype for a [platform for serverless hosting of Cardano dApps](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396549)!

If you develop a Cardano dApp, [please contact us to enter closed beta](mailto:streamcardano@migamake.com).
