[Snapbrillia](https://www.snapbrillia.com/) is a mentor-mentee marketplace of hiring bounties, workshops, and hackathons to foster a vibrant community of self-taught or underrepresented developers. In addition to open-source quadratic funding with Sybil resistance, we have DID Poof of Reputation and Cloud Collaborative IDE to accelerate mentor-mentee collaboration and learning. We are cornering "economic identity and opportunities" for self-taught, underrepresented developers, and a better future for all in and out of Cardano.
