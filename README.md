## Functionality

[StreamCardano](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396549) will make Cardano dApp creation more accessible, support dApp authors and make Cardano much easier platform to develop on.


    Our service will be contacted by JavaScript/TypeScript/PureScript library that connects our backend to get live updates of Cardano blockchain. There will be also user interface for trying the queries during development, and setting automated runs of Cardano Wallet scripts whenever query triggers.

    Our main deliverables will be example apps that developers can adapt to use our serverless service.

## Milestones

1. Technology teaser: we will deliver technology teaser, where frontend apps are running. Interested developers will be able to interact with our example apps to prove that they run on live testnet. We will  ask interested parties to register for closed beta. Our apps will allow the following functionality to be seen:
   * seeing the latest testnet block status
   * website with live updates of ADA transaction volume
   * website with live updates of a MILK token price

2. Closed beta: we will request users to register for closed beta of our serverless query service, and help them to develop their apps using this service. At this stage we will provide these:
    * benchmarks for number of queries supported by service in parallel
    * free user support to help users build apps, with direct connection to developers
    * service status page
    * functionality test tracking pages
    * online IDE
Within 2 month from the project start.

3. Public beta: we will accept user registrations for the full SaaS:
   * at this moment we will allow user registrations
   * we will also provide a smart contract calling service that would be automatically triggered by the updates on the blockchain
   * customer support site for filing tickets
   * webhooks triggered by updates on the Cardano blockchain
Within 4 months from the project start

4. Official release:
    * official SLA for public users
    * optional AWS marketplace image for corporate users
    * live monitor of query isolation
    * billings
    * account quota and billing warnings
    * Cardano Summit presentation

   Within 6 months from the project start.

5. Community Growth stage:
   * trainings at blockchain conferences
   * marketing within Cardano local communities
   * service support and monitoring
   * features and bug fixing upon user request
   * monitoring service security
   * biweekly Q&A, and monthly use case
   
   Within 12 months from project start.
